    <!-- STATEMENT -->
    <article class="statement">
        <p>At the Panoply, we know that we are facing an imminent climate and ecological crisis. We have been working to understand our impact and find ways in which we can be part of the solution.</p> 
        <p><strong>What we have discovered is that the contribution of the digital economy to climate change is shocking, and it is growing at an alarming rate.</strong></p>
        <p>Digital emissions are largely invisible. We don’t see dirty smoke coming out of our devices every time we browse the web, but that doesn’t make the impact any less real.</p>
        <p>This week, thousands of people are taking to the streets to demand climate action. At the Panoply, that action starts today.</p>

    <!-- PLAN -->
    <section class="plan">
        <p>Here is how we plan to start our journey towards building a sustainable digital industry. We will keep you updated with our progress and share anything that might be useful so that together, we can make bigger changes sooner.
